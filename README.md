# Third-Checkpoint
# Hi there 👋
  👂 # Hawk

This is third checkpoint for `Hack It Out` hackathon organised under Technex'24.
# Problem statement :-
Biodiversity Conservation: Develop tools that contribute to the preservation of biodiversity and the protection of endangered species. This could include applications for monitoring wildlife, tracking deforestation, or promoting sustainable agricultural practices.

# DESCRIPTION 
Our product functions by utilizing two sensors: the DHT22 Temperature and Humidity Sensor and the MQ135 Air Quality Sensor. These sensors collect data from the soil that includes  temperature, humidity, and air quality. This information is then processed to determine the appropriate actions to  be take. Commands are sent to various systems such as the drip irrigation based on the analyzed data. Additionally, the data collected is displayed in real-time on the accompanying mobile application, providing users with insights into the crop conditions.
The parameters are measured and recorded through thingsspeak API .
